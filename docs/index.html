    </section>
    <section id="Origin">
        <h2>Why was Community Link Created?</h2>
        <p>The idea for this application came after the fires Texas had in early 2024. During the fire, people had to use many applications to fill their communication needs and request help with various situations. This application aims to serve as a single place that can fill these needs.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>Community Link offers a wide range of features to facilitate communication, coordination, and support within communities. Here are some of the most important features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request Management: Requestors can make requests for monetary donations, physical donations, and volunteer assistance. Volunteers can make monetary donations online, physical donations would need to be taken to a physical location for quality control and to ensure that the item donated matches what the request is looking for.</li>
            <li>Donation Management: Volunteers can make monetary donations through the application. They can make physical donations to specific requests or donate items to the organization itself. Any physical donations would need to be managed by employees of the organization for quality control.</li>
            <li>Inventory Management: Employees can manage inventory currently held by the organization, ensuring they go to storage locations that can hold the donated item.</li>
            <li>Location Management: Employees with admin level access can manage locations available for inventory to be stored.</li>
            <li>Event Management: Employees can plan events and even sent inventory to them if the inventory isnâ€™t meant for a request. Users can RSVP to these events to help with planning.</li>
            <li>Messages: signed in users can message other users.</li>
            <li>Statistics: Signed in users can see their own statistics and employees can see overall statistics for the organization.</li>
