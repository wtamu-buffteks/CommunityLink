# CommunityLink
CommunityLink has been set as the running name

# Prerequisites for Running the Application:
.NET Version 8

Make sure you have version 8 of .NET installed.
To check your installed version, run the following command:

dotnet --version

If you don't have version 8 installed, download it from <a src="dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0">here</a>:

dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

MySQL
Since our previous database is down, you'll need to have MySQL installed. You can download and install MySQL from <a src="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">here</a>: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. Make sure to set up a local database for the application to connect to.

Recommended IDE
We recommend using Visual Studio Code for development. You can download it from <a src="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>: https://code.visualstudio.com/. You will also need the C# extension for better support of .NET projects.

Browser
Any modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge will work to access and test the locally hosted web app.

# Setup:

## Restore Dependencies 

- Run the following command to ensure that all required dependencies are downloaded: <strong>dotnet restore</strong>

## Set Up MySQL Database

- Open MySQL Workbench (or another MySQL management tool) and create a new database. Take note of the database name, username, and password.

## Update Connection String

- In the appsettings.json file, update the CommunityLinkContext connection string to point to your local MySQL database. Ensure the connection string includes the correct database name, username, and password.

## Clean Outdated Migrations

- Delete the now outdated Migrations folder

## Create New Migration

- Run the following command to create a new migration named InitialCreate: <strong>dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate</strong>

## Apply Migrations to Database

- Run the following command to apply the migration and update the database schema: <strong>dotnet ef database update
</strong>

## Run the Application

- Finally, start the application with: <strong>dotnet run</strong>

# Procedural Guidelines

========================================================
<br>
***Always post a message on discord within the BUFFTEKS PROJECT announcing what feature you're working on.***
<br>

========================================================

This will ensure that people are not working on the same feature at once (which could lead to code conflicts).

We will be following the coding conventions found within the .NET documentation. Links to the guides will be added for further reading.

A changelog has been created. The changelog will be used to document any major changes or changes that can be explained in a sentence. This differs from commit messages in that it is not required for minor code fixes and does not track individual contributors. It will give us a better overall perspective of what our code is doing and how it is evolving.

## Style Guidelines
### *** C# Code conventions: [link to conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)

### *** .NET formatting options: [ link to options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/dotnet-formatting-options) 

<ol>
<li>Sort system import directives first </li>
<li>Seperate system directive groups</li>
</ol>

>  // dotnet_separate_import_directive_groups
>  <br>using System.Collections.Generic;
>  <br>using System.Threading.Tasks;

>  using Octokit;

### *** C# formating options: [ link to options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/csharp-formatting-options)

The link will lead to a page that has examples of all of the options regarding each of these sections:
<ul>
<li> New-Line options</li>
<li> Indentation Options</li>
<li> Spacing Options</li>
<li> Wrap Options</li>
</ul>

## Branching Strategy: Branches

[link to GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)

### ðŸŒ¿ Main Branch:
This branch will hold all ***stable*** versions.

### ðŸŒ¿ Development Branch:
This branch will be used for pulling, testing, and developing stable versions.

### ðŸŒ¿ Feature Branches:
We will create separate branches for the development of individual features.  

Branches should be named in a way that explains what feature or issue is being worked on. For example: `feature/login-page` or `bugfix/issue-123`.

## Branching Strategy: GitHub flow
### Make a Branch:
Make a feature branch to work on

### Make Changes:
When making changes to your branch give descriptive commit messages, so your fellow developers know what you were working on.

### Pull Request:
Create pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. Include a description of what the proposed new code does (Ex: does is fix something? does it add a feature?). You can add comments to specific lines of the pull request if you want to emphasizes parts of your code to reviewers.

### Testing and Merging:

Once a feature branch is complete and tested, it should be merged into the development branch.

Thorough testing should include following the "happy path" and the "not-happy path." Ex. if you make a form for a phone number test it with valid numbers as well as a sting of letters and symbols.

After thorough testing in the development branch, stable changes can be merged into the main branch.


### Delete your Branch

After merging your pull request, delete the branch on the repository. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches. You can keep a local copy of the branch for back up purposes.
